This is the public repository for the work completed for the paper "Comparison of multiple surrogates for 3D CFD model in tidal farm optimisation", to be submitted to the Hydroinformatics conference 2016. It will include the code and information required to (hopeuflly) reproduce the research.

## To be included in this directory/readme:

* Project introduction
  * Hydro electric turbine state of research
  * Projects + findings
  * How this project fits in.
* Introduction to CFD modelling (OpenFOAM, convention, set up, Mulualem's research).
* Introduction to MO Optimisation (Michele, details, process)
* Introduction to our research
  * Requirments, understanding, objectives.
  * For each stage: configuration, environment and tools. System configuration/specification.
  * Stage I: gathering data
    * OpenFOAM conventions, bash, ssh, screen. Expectations, common issues. All files.
  * Stage II: Modelling
    * Approaches, software/tools spec => Summary of work in notebooks.
  * Stage III: Optimisation
    * ditto.
